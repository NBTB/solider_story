In March of 1861, President Lincoln takes office and delivers his First Inaugural Address (include this address?) which asserts his intention to preserve the union by compromise.<br/><br/>One month later, however, Fort Sumter is besieged by Confederates, and taken. Lincoln calls for 75,000 men to preserve the Union, but his call to arms galvanizes the Border States. A handful more of them secede and war is begun.]]></Content>

You and your wife, with whom you have been married only around five years, grow produce and raise chickens. What you don't eat yourselves you sell to a man in town who himself takes it to the city to peddle.<br/><br/>Today, you heard the news that the president is calling for more troops. You wouldn't normally be interested, but everyone else seems so enthused about enlisting, and the signing bonus would help buy that horse-drawn plow you've been eyeing. Of course, going off to war would mean leaving your wife and children alone on the farm.<br/><br/>They say it will be a 30 days war. You'd be back in time for the harvest, anyway, right?]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[The area around here is not what you had pictured as a battlefield before the war. The ground gently slopes forming uneven fields. Lonesome trees and small stands are here there poking up through the grass. The borders of the fields are variously thickets of small shrubs or thick forest.<br/><br/>The march has been stop-and-go as streams are forded; wagons and caissons get stuck.<br/><br/>You stop yet again. Many soldiers make themselves comfortable. As the minutes wear on, it becomes obvious that this is no ordinary stop. Soldiers ahead begin to march off sideways to form a battle line. The battery atop the hill can be seen scurrying around their guns, when all of a sudden they leap aside just in time for the cannon to emit a burst of bright smoke and with it a thunderous boom.<br/><br/>The war music is playing now, and you see the brigade commander talking to your staff officer. The men are already on their feet when the staff officer approaches with the orders.<br/><br/>You march into position and receive the order to load-at-will… Shortly thereafter is the order to fire.<br/<br/>In the heat of the battle, the formerly organized defensive line is forgotten, and soldiers are crouching behind any cover they can find – trees, ditches, even fence rails. They all still maintain a general grouping around their regimental colors, however.]]></Content>

		<Content><![CDATA[The battling is fierce, minnie balls squealing past overhead and thudding as they embed into trees or softly gasping as they burrow into the ground.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the order is given to “dress on colors”, and – those men that can – form up on the colors in preparation for a charge. <br/><br/>The soldiers put on their most intimidating grimace as the charge begins. All semblance of formation is lost as the men are consumed with battle fury – whooping and hollering as they go.<br/><br/>The yelling serves to lift the heart out of fear, but also to strike the same into the enemy. The helter-skelter crowd races towards the enemy, whose location is evidenced only by the plume of smoke at the opposite end of the field. The whizzing of bullets can still be heard, and every now and then so can a grunt and a thud, as a man is injured and falls.<br/><br/>Screaming now almost as much with fear as with fury, you raise your bayonet in preparation for plunging into the enemy ranks, but as you crest the ridge, there is no one to be seen. Farther down the line, there is an abandoned battery of six guns being cautiously examined by some other men.<br/><br/>Some other soldiers are now hollering “we won!” and cheering. Shortly, the general himself appears and compliments you and your company for capturing a battery of artillery.]]></Content>

There doesn’t seem to be any sign of the enemy, and one soldier points farther down the field to a group of friendly soldiers on the other side of the field. <br/><br/>It seems the battle has been won after all.]]></Content>

Clutching at the pain, you feel moist cloth, and withdraw a red-stained hand. <br/><br/>You try to roll over, and find that neither can you move your left arm, nor is its newfound degree of freedom very pleasant.<br/><br/>Yelling for help, you are largely ignored or told to be quiet and wait for the stretcher-bearers.<br/><br/>The shouting, booming, and crackling of musket-fire blend together as you struggle to stay awake, when you become aware of someone talking to you.<br/><br/>“— you stand up?”<br/><br/>You confirm. The tourniquet they put around your arm is extremely tight, but at least it’s a distraction. The medics made a sling for you from part of your uniform, and help you on your feet.<br/><br/>The soldiers are expressionless as they collect the wounded, who shamble or are carried to an ambulance wagon. The stretchers take a lot of space in the wagons, and some of the less wounded must cling to the steps of the wagons while in motion. It’s a bumpy ride, but pain keeps the noise to a low groan.]]></Content>

Here too there hangs in the air a painful absence of screaming. Whether this is due more to pain, fear, or anesthetic is unknowable.<br/><br/>Before taking a seat, a convalescent hands you a cup of liquor, “to help you calm down,” he says.<br/><br/>When the surgeon finally reaches you, the prescription is a foregone conclusion: amputation. You are given an inhaler of chloroform, a curious device the size of a deck of cards with two tubes poking out, one for air to go in, one for air to go out. Breathing through the device, you begin to feel drowsy, but still awake.<br/><br/>After moving you to the operating table, the surgeon begins poking the wound with his fingers to find debris and fragments of bullet, and once satisfied begins the procedure.<br/><br/>By the end, there is a moist bandage wrapped around your foreshortened limb and a new arm on the pile.]]></Content>
