			<Content>The histories of war are often told by the winner.  Surviving documentary evidence may be more plentiful for one side than for the other.  We have attempted to portray both sides of the conflict with appropriate historic images, however, for some scenes depicting soldiers' daily life, we have used the same image for both sides.</Content>

		<Content>In November of 1860, Abraham Lincoln is elected President of the United States. The next month, the Southern states begin to secede. In March of 1861, President Lincoln takes office and delivers his &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html"&gt;First Inaugural Address&lt;/a&gt;, which asserts his intention to preserve the Union by compromise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One month later, however, Fort Sumter is besieged and taken by Confederates. Lincoln calls for 75,000 men to preserve the Union, but his call to arms galvanizes the border states. A handful more of them secede and war is begun.</Content>

		<Content>The Confederate States: South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Confederate States have a population of 9,103,332, including  slaves. Only 316,632 people, however, which was less than 10% of the free population, actually  own slaves. Except for the black slaves (and few free blacks), there is very little ethnic diversity, and, there are no big cities except for New Orleans.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone you know curses those Yankees for not letting the Southerners be as they are. Many have done the honorable thing and enlisted to fight for home and freedom by driving the Yankees out. Why would any self-respecting man not join them?</Content>

The landscape varies from farmland to mines to factories in the cities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though Lincoln wants only to preserve the Union, there are many who want more. You, however, just want to see the country, fight some rebels, and earn a decent wage.</Content>

		<Content>Life for you here in your hometown is quiet but fairly productive. You own a small farm in the countryside just outside a small town. Although slavery is legal in your state, you are not wealthy enough to own any. You and your wife, with whom you have been married only around five years, grow produce and raise chickens. What you don't eat yourselves you sell to a man in town who himself takes it to the city to peddle. Today, you heard the news that President Davis is calling for more troops. You wouldn't normally be interested, but everyone else seems so enthused about enlisting, and the signing bonus would help buy that horse-drawn plow you've been eyeing. Of course, going off to war would mean leaving your wife and children alone on the farm. They say it will be a 30 days war. You'd be back in time for the harvest, anyway, right?</Content>

		<Content>These days the master has gotten anxious. At first, none of the slaves had any idea why, but lately you've heard there's an army approaching to free the slaves. When one of the other slaves asked the master about it, he seemed rattled, then retorted that the army was coming to kill all the blacks, because if they couldn't have slaves, they didn't want anyone to have them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't tell whether he's lying, but you might not find out, anyway, because the master says all the slaves are being shipped out to work for the war effort tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That night, some slaves are gathering what they can in makeshift sacks. They're going to run away and take their chances with the army. After all, it couldn't be worse, right?</Content>

You have to avoid the roads, sticking to the fields and especially trees whenever possible. Eventually, you feel like you are far enough away, and settle down to wait for the army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Days go by, and you start to think you made a mistake, when you stop and listen carefully. Off in the distance, a crackling and rumbling like you've never heard before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You rush towards the sound, but by the time you reach the battlefield it is already a gruesome scene. The only living soldiers are carrying bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You follow them back to a camp, and are directed to an officer. You plead for him to let you join the army and fight your oppressors.</Content>

		<Content>Life for you here in your hometown is not too easy. Living in an apartment within the city limits, you work at a mill on the river's edge. You and your wife, with whom you have been married only around five years, have two children, and another on the way. Feeding your growing family is hard on a laborer's wage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, you heard the news that President Lincoln is calling for more troops. You wouldn't normally be interested, but everyone else seems so enthused about enlisting, and the signing bonus would help buy some new clothes for your oldest. Of course, going off to war would mean leaving your wife and children by themselves, but a soldier is paid more than a millworker...</Content>

		<Content>At the very least, it has been an exciting few years since moving out West to work in the mines. You, your family, and all the other miners and their families live in rough plank sheds down the hill from the mine. You and your wife, who immigrated to America with you six years ago, have three children. It would be hard enough to feed them without the scarcity of food and water out here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, you heard the news that President Lincoln is calling for more troops. You wouldn't normally be interested, since you wouldn't earn that much more as a soldier, but everyone else seems so enthused about enlisting, and there has been talk about the mines drying up soon. If you were a soldier, you wouldn't have to deal with cramped tunnels, cave-ins, or pools of scalding hot water, but of course you might be shot. And true, going off to war would mean leaving your wife and children by themselves, but soldiering could be a steady job... if you survive.</Content>

		<Content>The President has said the war isn't about slavery, but you know better. All of the states that have seceded are slave states. Defeating the Confederacy can only open great oppurtunities for Blacks. So, with great pride and enthusiasm, you appear before the recruiters and volunteer to go to war for the Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their response surprises you. "We cannot accept your enlistment," they say. Something about a law against Blacks in the army. You plead, but they begin to force you out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disappointed, you head home.</Content>

Once everyone has their food, the soldiers begin breaking off into groups to share cooking fires. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within your group, there is a man who everyone agrees is the best cook, so they all let him cook their meals in exchange for small favors here and there. In some other groups, you can see people cooking for themselves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having never really tried your hand at cooking, you decide to let the group's cook handle your food.</Content>

		<Content>Sometime today, a traveling merchant wandered into the camp. The fellows are all gathered around the back of his wagon where his goods are on display. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are closer, you hear him talking about an "amazing water filterer" that, he claims, can filter and make safe even the dirtiest of water. It seems to be a rubber tube with a mouthpiece at one end and a cone-shaped, porous stone at the other end. "Just put the water you want to drink in your canteen," he says, "and put this end in with it, then drink from here!" &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next he pulls out (with some effort) what appear to be a vest with metal plates stitched into the front of it. "This," he begins, "is no less than a bullet-proof vest!" There is a murmur of mixed excitement and disbelief from the crowd. "Wearing this," he continues, "you cannot be hurt by musket balls!" You wonder about what would happen if it was shot by a musket ball, but he assures the crowd that anyone wearing the vest would be safe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is getting later now and a few soldiers are haggling with the merchant, but others are going off to make use of the little free time left.</Content>

		<Content>“My Dear Wife,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I miss you greatly. The camp here is nothing like home. I often find myself craving a delicious roast like we used to have. Here we only occasionally get fresh meat, usually only salt meat. It makes a fellow quite thirsty. And at least at home there was a roof over my head.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How are the children? I&apos;m sorry I won&apos;t be there to see them grow up, but I&apos;ll be back as soon as I can. I hope you are doing alright, and the children aren&apos;t too much trouble.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please write me back when you receive this letter, I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Signed, Your Loving Husband”</Content>

		<Content>The walking tires you out faster than the other soldiers because you are carrying the metal vest you purchased from the merchant. In fact, it wouldn&apos;t fit in your sack, so you decided to wear it while walking. The weight and stiffness of the metal makes walking difficult and makes your skin and uniform clammy. You&apos;ve already dropped a few rows (such as they are) backwards in the march. At this rate, you wonder if you&apos;ll even make it to camp.</Content>

		<Content>You stop yet again. The area around here is not what you had pictured as a battlefield before the war. The ground gently slopes forming uneven fields. Lonesome trees and small stands are here and there poking up through the grass. The borders of the fields are variously thickets of small shrubs or thick forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many soldiers make themselves comfortable. As the minutes wear on, it becomes obvious that this is no ordinary stop. Soldiers ahead begin to march off sideways to form a battle line. The battery atop the hill can be seen scurrying around their guns, when all of a sudden they leap aside just in time for the cannon to emit a burst of bright smoke and with it a thunderous boom.</Content>

All semblance of formation is lost as the men are consumed with battle fury, whooping and hollering as they go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The yelling serves to lift the heart out of fear, but also to strike fear into the enemy. The helter-skelter crowd races towards the enemy, whose location is evidenced only by the plume of smoke at the opposite end of the field. The whizzing of bullets can still be heard, and every now and then so can a grunt and a thud, as a man is injured and falls.</Content>

Your eyes are drawn to its source: an artillery piece&apos;s muzzle flash from the left side of the enemies&apos; ranks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Less than a second later, your ranks are met with canister shot as they whiz through the air, burrow through the men, and come to rest in small puffs of dirt.

Clutching at the pain, you feel moist cloth, and withdraw a red-stained hand. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You try to roll over, and find that you can not  move your left arm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yelling for help, you are largely ignored or told to be quiet and wait for the stretcher-bearers.</Content>

		<Content>This goes on for what seems to be days, although it can&apos;t have been, since the sun never set. Your hands and face are black with powder, your throat hoarse from smoke and yelling. You and the other soldiers are running low on ammunition and morale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abruptly, the crack of gunfire from the enemy ranks ceases. Hesitantly, one of the soldiers peeks out from behind his cover, gasps, and stands up to run away. Peering around the corner, you see why: the enemy has regrouped and has begun to charge, whooping and hollering, bayonets aimed at you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just then, an officer rides up on his horse, yelling "retreat!" The soldiers don't need to be told twice.</Content>

Perhaps it is the shock that makes it easier to ignore the deaths, yet every so often someone calls out to a friend to hear their story. The call is met with silence. Before long, though, another soldier speaks up and tells another tale to lighten the mood.</Content>
