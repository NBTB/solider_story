		<Content>In November of 1860, Abraham Lincoln is elected President of the United States. The next month, the southern states begin to secede. In March of 1861, President Lincoln takes office and delivers his &lt;a href="http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html"&gt;First Inaugural Address&lt;/a&gt;, which asserts his intention to preserve the union by compromise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One month later, however, Fort Sumter is besieged by Confederates, and taken. Lincoln calls for 75,000 men to preserve the Union, but his call to arms galvanizes the Border States. A handful more of them secede and war is begun.</Content>

But less than 10% of the free population, only 316,632 people, own any slaves at all. Except for the black slaves (and few free blacks), there is very little ethnic diversity, and except for New Orleans, no big cities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Everyone you know curses those Yankees for not letting the Southerners be as they are. Many have done the honorable thing and enlisted to fight for home and freedom by driving the Yankees out. Why would any self-respecting man not join them?</Content>

		<Prompt>It is a misconception that the war was fought by the North to end slavery. The abolitionists called for an end to slavery, but Lincoln did not make ending slavery a condition of ending the war until the &lt;a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/"&gt;Emancipation Proclamation&lt;/a&gt; of 1863.</Prompt>

		<Content>Life for you here in your hometown is quiet but fairly productive. You own a small farm in the countryside just outside a small town. Although slavery is legal in your state, you are not wealthy enough to own any. You and your wife, with whom you have been married only around five years, grow produce and raise chickens. What you don't eat yourselves you sell to a man in town who himself takes it to the city to peddle. Today, you heard the news that the president is calling for more troops. You wouldn't normally be interested, but everyone else seems so enthused about enlisting, and the signing bonus would help buy that horse-drawn plow you've been eyeing. Of course, going off to war would mean leaving your wife and children alone on the farm. They say it will be a 30 days war. You'd be back in time for the harvest, anyway, right?</Content>

		<Content>These days the master has gotten anxious. At first, none of the slaves had any idea why, but lately you've heard there's an army approaching to free the slaves. When one of the other slaves asked him about it, he seemed rattled, then retorted that the army was coming to kill all the blacks, because if they couldn't have slaves, they didn't want anyone to have them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can't tell whether he's lying, but you might not find out, anyway, because the master says all the slaves are being shipped out to work for the war effort tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That night, some slaves are gathering what they can in makeshift sacks. They're going to run away and take their chances with the army. After all, it couldn't be worse, right?</Content>

You have to avoid the roads, sticking to the fields and especially trees whenever possible. Eventually, you feel like you are far enough away, and settle down to wait for the army.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Days go by, and you start to think you made a mistake, when you stop and listen carefully. Off in the distance, a crackling and rumbling like you've never heard before.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You rush towards the sound, but by the time you reach the battlefield it is already a gruesome scene. The only living soldiers are carrying bodies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You follow them back to a camp, and are directed to an officer. You plead for him to let you join the army and fight your oppressors.</Content>

You, your family, and all the other miners and their families live in rough plank sheds down the hill from the mine.

You wouldn't normally be interested, since you wouldn't earn that much more as a soldier, but everyone else seems so enthused about enlisting, and there has been talk about the mines drying up soon. If you were a soldier, you wouldn't have to deal with cramped tunnels, cave-ins, or pools of scalding hot water, but of course you might be shot. And true, going off to war would mean leaving your wife and children alone, but soldiering could be a steady job... if you survive.</Content>

So, with great pride and enthusiasm, you appear before the recruiters and volunteer to go to war for the Union.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their response surprises you. "We cannot accept your enlistment," they say. Something about a law against blacks in the army. You plead, but they begin to force you out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disappointed, you head home.</Content>

		<Content>Much later, you hear the good news: the president has issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which frees all of the slaves in the Confederacy! As well, this makes the abolition of slavery a goal of the war, in addition to reunification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Once again enthusiastic about fighting for such a noble and important cause, you decide to try to enlist again. Sure enough, the recruiters are now accepting black soldiers. It's time to fight for your rights.</Content>

Everyone is taking the day off to see the band from the big city play. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The band plays a selection of pieces so stirring that you can't help but imagine a battalion of troops marching in strict formation towards battle, bayonet-tipped muskets pointed sharply to the heavens, steeling themselves for battle. It almost brings a tear to your eye to think of the bravery and valor of the men in the army now, fighting for the cause. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several men have walked up to the stage and are signing the enlistment roll now.</Content>

		<Content>Sometime today, a traveling merchant wandered into the camp. The fellows are all gathered around the back of his wagon where his goods are on display. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you are closer, you hear him talking about an "amazing water filterer" that, he claims, can filter and make safe even the dirtiest of water. It seems to be a rubber tube with a mouthpiece at one end and a cone-shaped, porous stone at the other end. "Just put the water you want to drink in your canteen," he says, "and put this end in with it, then drink from here!". &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next he pulls out (with some effort) what appear to be a vest with metal plates stitched into the front of it. "This," he begins, "is no less than a bullet-proof vest!" There is a murmur of mixed excitement and disbelief from the crowd. "Wearing this," he continues, "you cannot be hurt by musket balls!" You wonder about what would happen if it was shot by a musket ball, but he assures the crowd that anyone wearing the vest would be safe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is getting later now and a few soldiers are haggling with the merchant, but others are going off to make use of the little free time left.</Content>

He asks $50 for it.  A steep price -- more than four months worth of pay -- but if it saves your life, it's worth it, right?</Content>

		<Content>You approach the merchant and ask to see the water filterer. Holding it in your hands, it is quite a simple device indeed. You tell the merchant you are interested in purchasing the device. He asks $8 for it.  It is quite expensive, at more than a half months pay, but it should more than make up for it when you are thirsty on the road, right?</Content>

You've already dropped a few rows (such as they are) backwards in the march. At this rate, you wonder if you'll even make it to camp.</Content>

You and your company pack up your possessions and then the tent, and begin marching. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The marching is hard work, since you are carrying all of your gear. In the middle of the day, there is a break to eat. As the day wears on, what was once strict formation is now merely a ramshackle crowd of soldiers stumbling down the road.</Content>

The long roll sounds, and all is chaos as everyone dashes to grab their weapons and form a defensive line.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Then, from the darkness, you hear a sergeant’s voice yelling that everything is fine, it was only a pig that got loose in the camp and was mistaken for a rebel.

Lonesome trees and small stands are here and there poking up through the grass. The borders of the fields are variously thickets of small shrubs or thick forest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many soldiers make themselves comfortable. As the minutes wear on, it becomes obvious that this is no ordinary stop. Soldiers ahead begin to march off sideways to form a battle line. The battery atop the hill can be seen scurrying around their guns, when all of a sudden they leap aside just in time for the cannon to emit a burst of bright smoke and with it a thunderous boom.</Content>

		<Content>The battling is fierce, minnie balls squealing past overhead and thudding as they embed into trees or softly gasping as they burrow into the ground.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Suddenly, the order is given to “dress on colors”, and – those men that can – form up on the colors in preparation for a charge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soldiers put on their most intimidating grimace as the charge begins. All semblance of formation is lost as the men are consumed with battle fury – whooping and hollering as they go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The yelling serves to lift the heart out of fear, but also to strike the same into the enemy. The helter-skelter crowd races towards the enemy, whose location is evidenced only by the plume of smoke at the opposite end of the field. The whizzing of bullets can still be heard, and every now and then so can a grunt and a thud, as a man is injured and falls.</Content>

Farther down the line, there is an abandoned battery of six guns being cautiously examined by some other men.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some other soldiers are now hollering “we won!” and cheering. Shortly, the general himself appears and compliments you and your company for capturing a battery of artillery.</Content>

Your eyes are drawn to its source: an artillery piece's muzzle flash from the left side of the enemies' ranks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Less than a second later, your ranks are met with grapeshot as they whiz through the air, burrow through the men, and come to rest in small puffs of dirt.

The tourniquet they put around your arm is extremely tight, but at least it’s a distraction. The medics made a sling for you from part of your uniform, and help you on your feet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The soldiers are expressionless as they collect the wounded, who shamble or are carried to an ambulance wagon. The stretchers take a lot of space in the wagons, and some of the less wounded must cling to the steps of the wagons while in motion. It’s a bumpy ride, but pain keeps the noise to a low groan.</Content>
